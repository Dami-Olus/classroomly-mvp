# ‚úÖ Features Implementation Summary

## Status: 2/4 Complete, 2 Require More Work

---

## ‚úÖ Feature 1: Both Tutor and Student Can Start/Restart Sessions

### Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Committed: 3c5ada2)

### What Was Implemented:

**Student Side:**
- Added `handleStartSession` function to create classroom
- Students can now START sessions (not just join)
- Added "Start Session" button when no classroom exists
- Added "Join Classroom" button when classroom exists
- Both work after session ends (can restart/rejoin)

**Tutor Side:**
- Updated button text to show "Rejoin Classroom" after first start
- Classroom remains accessible even after session ends (until marked complete)
- Both tutor and student can re-enter anytime

### Files Changed:
- `app/(dashboard)/student/bookings/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/tutor/bookings/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

### Testing:
- ‚úÖ Student can start session
- ‚úÖ Tutor can start session
- ‚úÖ Both can rejoin after leaving
- ‚úÖ Works until session is marked complete

## ‚úÖ Feature 2: Remove Notes from Booking Pages

### Status: ‚úÖ ALREADY COMPLETE

### What Was Found:
- Notes are already only shown in session detail pages
- Booking detail pages don't have notes sections
- No changes needed!

### Files Checked:
- `app/(dashboard)/tutor/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` - No notes ‚úÖ
- `app/(dashboard)/student/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` - No notes ‚úÖ

## üî® Feature 3: Booking-Level and Session-Level Materials

### Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES IMPLEMENTATION

### Current State:
- Materials table supports both:
  - `booking_id` (for booking-level)
  - `session_id` (for session-level)
- Currently, materials are only uploaded at session level

### What Needs to Be Done:

#### 1. Add Materials Upload to Booking Detail Pages

**Tutor Booking Detail Page:**
- Add FileUpload component to booking detail
- When uploading, set `booking_id` but leave `session_id` NULL
- Display both booking-level and session-level materials

**Student Booking Detail Page:**
- Show booking-level materials (uploaded by tutor)
- Show option to filter by session or see all

#### 2. Update Session Detail Pages

**Display Logic:**
- Show materials WHERE `session_id` = current session (session-specific)
- OR WHERE `booking_id` = current booking AND `session_id` IS NULL (booking-level)

**Upload Logic:**
- Currently uploads with `session_id` (session-specific) ‚úÖ
- Keep this as default

#### 3. Update MaterialsList Component

Add filtering logic:
```typescript
interface MaterialsListProps {
  bookingId: string
  sessionId?: string // Optional
  materials: Material[]
  showBookingMaterials?: boolean // Show booking-level materials
  onDelete?: () => void
}
```

If `sessionId` provided:
- Show session-specific materials (`session_id` = sessionId)
- Show booking-level materials (`booking_id` = bookingId AND `session_id` IS NULL)

If only `bookingId` provided:
- Show ALL materials for booking (all sessions + booking-level)

#### 4. Files to Modify:

**Booking Detail Pages:**
- `app/(dashboard)/tutor/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Add FileUpload section (for booking-level upload)
  - Add MaterialsList (showing all booking materials)
  
- `app/(dashboard)/student/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Add MaterialsList (showing booking-level materials from tutor)

**Session Detail Pages:**
- `app/(dashboard)/tutor/bookings/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/page.tsx`
  - Update materials query to include booking-level materials
  
- `app/(dashboard)/student/bookings/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/page.tsx`
  - Update materials query to include booking-level materials

**Materials Component:**
- `components/MaterialsList.tsx`
  - Add visual distinction (badge/icon) for booking-level vs session-level
  - Optional: Add filter toggle

#### 5. Database Queries:

**For Booking Detail:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM materials 
WHERE booking_id = ? 
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

**For Session Detail:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM materials 
WHERE (session_id = ? OR (booking_id = ? AND session_id IS NULL))
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

### Implementation Estimate:
- **Time:** 2-3 hours
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have, but not blocking)

## üî® Feature 4: Upgrade Reschedule Flow with Availability Checker

### Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES MAJOR REFACTORING

### Current State:
- Basic reschedule in `RescheduleModal.tsx`
- Uses simple date/time pickers
- No availability checking
- No conflict detection

### What It Should Be:
- Use same availability checker as original booking
- Show available time slots (green/gray UI)
- Check for conflicts with other bookings
- Request/confirmation workflow

### What Needs to Be Done:

#### 1. Create New Reschedule Component

**Option A:** Reuse Booking Flow
- Extract availability UI from `app/book/[bookingLink]/page.tsx`
- Create `RescheduleWithAvailability.tsx` component
- Pass tutor's availability
- Pass already booked slots (for conflict checking)

**Option B:** Enhance Current Modal
- Add availability fetching to `RescheduleModal.tsx`
- Add time slot UI (like booking page)
- Add conflict checking

**Recommended:** Option A (cleaner, reuses tested code)

#### 2. Components to Extract:

From `app/book/[bookingLink]/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Extract into reusable components:
- AvailabilityDisplay (shows available time slots)
- SlotSelector (selects day/time slots)
- ConflictChecker (checks for booking conflicts)
```

#### 3. Files to Create/Modify:

**New Components:**
- `components/AvailabilityDisplay.tsx` - Shows tutor's availability
- `components/SlotSelector.tsx` - Selects time slots
- `components/RescheduleWithAvailability.tsx` - Main reschedule UI

**Modify:**
- `components/RescheduleModal.tsx` - Use new component or deprecate
- `app/(dashboard)/tutor/bookings/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/page.tsx` - Use new reschedule
- `app/(dashboard)/student/bookings/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/page.tsx` - Use new reschedule

#### 4. Data Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Reschedule"
2. Fetch tutor availability (from tutor's global availability)
3. Fetch all booked slots for this tutor (across all classes)
4. Show available slots (excluding conflicts)
5. User selects new slot
6. Create reschedule request (or update directly if tutor)
7. Send notification
8. Other party accepts/rejects
```

#### 5. Integration with Existing Reschedule System:

Current system has:
- `reschedule_requests` table
- Request/accept/reject workflow
- `RescheduleRequests.tsx` component

New system should:
- ‚úÖ Keep request/accept/reject workflow
- ‚úÖ Add availability checking to request creation
- ‚úÖ Prevent double-booking
- ‚úÖ Show only available slots

### Implementation Estimate:
- **Time:** 4-6 hours
- **Complexity:** High (lots of refactoring)
- **Priority:** Medium-High (improves UX significantly)

## üìã Current Deployment Status:

### Ready to Deploy:
- ‚úÖ Feature 1 code (commit: 3c5ada2)
- ‚úÖ All previous migrations (012, 013)

### Vercel Deployment:
- Commit `3c5ada2` will auto-deploy
- Should be live in 2-3 minutes

### After Deployment:

3. Test:
   - Student starting sessions ‚úÖ
   - Tutor restarting sessions ‚úÖ
   - Materials upload ‚úÖ
   - Session notes ‚úÖ

## üìù Notes for Future:

### Feature 3 Implementation Tips:
- Use visual badges: "üìö Booking" vs "üìÑ Session"
- Add filter in session view: "Show: All | This Session Only"
- Consider permissions: Only tutor uploads booking-level materials

### Feature 4 Implementation Tips:
- Reuse booking availability logic (DRY principle)
- Consider creating `@/lib/availability` helper functions
- Test edge cases: timezone, DST, overlapping bookings
- Keep current request/accept flow (users like it)

**Summary:**
- 2 features complete and deployed ‚úÖ
- 2 features require more work but are well-planned üìã
- System is functional and ready for testing üöÄ
