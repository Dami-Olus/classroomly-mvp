### ✅ Feature 4: Advanced Reschedule with Availability Checker

3. Select new slot (only available ones are clickable)
4. Enter reason for rescheduling
5. Click "Send Reschedule Request"
6. Other party receives request (in booking detail → Reschedule tab)
7. They accept or reject
8. If accepted: session is rescheduled

**For Both Users:**
