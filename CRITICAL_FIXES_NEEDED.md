## 🎯 **What Each Migration Does**

### **Migration 012: Fix Sessions RLS**
```sql
-- Drops old restrictive policy
-- Creates 3 new policies:
1. Tutors can create sessions
2. Students can create sessions for their bookings  
3. General policy for session creation
4. Tutors can update/delete sessions
```

**Result:** Sessions are created successfully when booking!

---

### **Migration 013: Fix Missing Columns**
```sql
-- Adds missing columns:
1. classrooms.session_id (links room to specific session)
2. materials.booking_id (links material to booking)

-- Consolidates materials tables:
- Renames session_materials to materials if needed
- Adds all necessary columns

-- Fixes RLS policies:
1. Materials: booking participants can view/upload/delete
2. Classrooms: both tutor AND student can start sessions
3. Sessions: both can update status
```

**Result:** All features work without column errors!

---

## 🐛 **Remaining Issues to Address**

### **Issue: Reschedule Session Flow**
**Current:** Session has its own reschedule button  
**Needed:** Should use the same reschedule request flow as booking detail page

**Solution:** I can implement this next if needed. It would:
- Remove direct reschedule from session detail
- Add "Request Reschedule" that creates a reschedule request
- Use the same accept/reject workflow
- Show reschedule requests in booking detail page

**Should I implement this now?**
