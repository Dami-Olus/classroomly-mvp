## Feature 3: ✅ Booking-Level and Session-Level Materials

**Booking-Level Materials:**
- Upload from booking detail page (Materials tab)
- Stored with `booking_id` and `session_id = NULL`
- Visible across ALL sessions in the booking
- Clear labeling: "📚 All Sessions"

**Session-Level Materials:**

- Only visible in that specific session
- Clear labeling: "📄 This Session"

- Purple badge: "📚 All Sessions" (booking-level)

## 📝 Important Notes

### Materials Logic:
```
Booking-Level: booking_id set, session_id = NULL
Session-Level: booking_id AND session_id both set
Class-Level: class_id set (future feature)
```

### Reschedule Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Request Reschedule"
2. Modal shows available slots
3. User selects new slot + reason
4. Request created (status: pending)
5. Other party accepts/rejects
6. If accepted: session updated
```

### Session Lifecycle:
```
scheduled → (can start) → active → (can complete) → completed
          ↓
     (can reschedule)
          ↓
     (can cancel)
```
