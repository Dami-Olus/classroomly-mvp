      body: "A student is waiting in the classroom"

## üìù Questions to Clarify

1. **Reports:** Should reports be auto-generated from session notes, or manually written?
2. **Waiting Room:** Should tutor manually admit students, or auto-admit with notification?
3. **Bulk Import:** What format is their current schedule? (Paper, Excel, Google Sheets?)
4. **Notifications:** Email, SMS, browser, or all three?

---

**Overall Sentiment: Very Positive! üéâ**

User is excited about the concept and sees clear value. Main blockers are:
- Monthly reports (workflow requirement)
- Onboarding existing students (adoption barrier)
- Concurrent session handling (confidence in platform)

Addressing these will significantly increase adoption likelihood.
